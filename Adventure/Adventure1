This is a very short text adventure. The goal here is testing my own grasp of knowledge on decision making in Java. I am practicing user input, and system output based on what the user decides. The adventure presents the user with 2 choices, each choice branching off into more decisions for a different experience each playthrough. The user will get a separate message if an invalid choice is made rather than the program simply terminating.

Things to imporve: -add looping so that adventure can be played multiple times without exiting program. -give user another chance to answer questions if invalid input is entered, rather than displaying a simple "else" statement followed by program termination.
